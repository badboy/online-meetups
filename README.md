# Experience with running online meetups

I run the [Rust Berlin Hack'n'Learn](https://berline.rs/2020/06/11/rust-hack-and-learn.html) meetup
and recently also started helping with the [Rust Berlin Rust'n'Tell](https://berline.rs/2020/05/26/rust-and-tell.html).
Both meetups became online meetups, when offices closed and people were forced to stay at home.

These are some rough notes on my experience with running online meetups.
Keep in mind these are only my notes on how I ran those meetups.
This is neither the only nor the absolut best way to run meetups.
