# More interactive: Hack'n'Learn

The Rust Berlin Hack'n'Learn is a bi-weekly (that is: every other week) meetup.
I've been running it for over 2 years now, all in all it's the longest running Rust meetup worldwide.

It's a mostly unstructured and agenda-less meetup that focuses on what its name promises: hacking & learning on and with Rust.
It's for beginners and experts alike and fosters an environment for discussion and learning.

In March 2020 it had to move to online venues.

## Video Meetup

Due to the nature of suddenly becoming an online meetup the first iterations happened on Zoom (see [the announcement](https://berline.rs/2020/03/19/rust-hack-and-learn.html)).
See [Talks](talks.md) for some setup.
In case of this meetup attendees were unable to unmute themselves as well as sharing their screen.

The attendees were mostly regulars plus a bunch of people from outside of Berlin, able to join the meetup for the first time.
It mostly came down to a big discussion around. I openly invited people to ask questions or present their project, including sharing code via screensharing or plain old links.
We accompanied it by a [shared document on HackMD](https://hackmd.io/) for notetaking.
