# More interactive: Hack'n'Learn

The Rust Berlin Hack'n'Learn is a bi-weekly (that is: every other week) meetup.
I've been running it for over 2 years now, all in all it's the longest running Rust meetup worldwide.

It's a mostly unstructured and agenda-less meetup that focuses on what its name promises: hacking & learning on and with Rust.
It's for beginners and experts alike and fosters an environment for discussion and learning.

In March 2020 it had to move to online venues.

## Video Meetup

Due to the nature of suddenly becoming an online meetup the first iterations happened on Zoom (see [the announcement](https://berline.rs/2020/03/19/rust-hack-and-learn.html)).
See [Talks](talks.md) for some setup.
In case of this meetup attendees were unable to unmute themselves as well as sharing their screen.

The attendees were mostly regulars plus a bunch of people from outside of Berlin, able to join the meetup for the first time.
It mostly came down to a big discussion around. I openly invited people to ask questions or present their project, including sharing code via screensharing or plain old links.
We accompanied it by a [shared document on HackMD](https://hackmd.io/) for notetaking.

### [Online Town](https://theonline.town/)

This free tool allows us to have spatialised voice as well as video chat, meaning we can walk around in a virtual 2D room and have multiple conversations at once, that we can participate in depending on how close we are to one another. It allows us to break into groups and hold side-conversations!

It (currently) doesn't allow screen-sharing, however.
